                        Elizabeth Woolridge Grant (born June 21, 1985), known professionally as Lana Del Rey, is an American singer and songwriter. Her music is noted for its cinematic quality and exploration of tragic romance, glamour, and melancholia, with frequent references to pop culture and 1950s–1970s Americana.[2] Her vintage Hollywood glamour aesthetic is showcased in her music videos. She is the recipient of various accolades, including an MTV Video Music Award, three MTV Europe Music Awards, two Brit Awards, two Billboard Women in Music awards and a Satellite Award, in addition to nominations for eleven Grammy Awards and a Golden Globe Award.[3] Variety honored her at their Hitmakers Awards for being "one of the most influential singer-songwriters of the 21st century". In 2023, Rolling Stone placed Del Rey on their list of the "200 Greatest Singers of All Time", while their sister publication Rolling Stone UK named her as "The Greatest American Songwriter of the 21st century".[4][5]

                    <h2>Early life</h2>

                    <p>
                        Elizabeth Grant was born on June 21, 1985,[15] in Manhattan, New York City,[16] to Robert England Grant Jr., a copywriter at Grey Group, and Patricia Ann "Pat" Grant (née Hill), an account executive at the same organization.[17][18][19] She has a younger sister, Caroline "Chuck" Grant,[20] and a younger brother, Charlie Grant.[21][22] She was raised Catholic and is of Scottish descent.[23][24] When she was one year old, the family moved to Lake Placid, New York.[25] In Lake Placid, her father worked for a furniture company before becoming an entrepreneurial domain investor;[26] her mother worked as a schoolteacher.[27] There, she attended St. Agnes School in her elementary years[22] and began singing in her church choir, where she was the cantor.[2

                    <h2>2011–2013: Breakthrough with Born to Die and Paradise</h2>

                    <p>
                        In 2011, Del Rey uploaded self-made music videos for her songs "Video Games" and "Blue Jeans" to YouTube, featuring vintage footage interspersed with shots of her singing on her webcam.[51] The "Video Games" music video became a viral internet sensation,[2] which led to Del Rey being signed by Stranger Records to release the song as her debut single.[52] She told The Observer: "I just put that song online a few months ago because it was my favorite. To be honest, it wasn't going to be the single but people have really responded to it."[16] The song earned her a Q award for "Next Big Thing" in October 2011[53] and an Ivor Novello for "Best Contemporary Song" in 2012.[54] In the same month, she signed a joint deal with Interscope Records and Polydor to release her second studio album Born to Die.[55] She started dating Scottish singer Barrie-James O'Neill in the same year. The couple split in 2014 after three years together.[56] Del Rey performed two songs from the album on Saturday Night Live on January 14, 2012, and received a negative response from various critics and the general public, who deemed the performance uneven and vocally shaky.[57][58] She had earlier defended her spot on the program, saying: "I'm a good musician ... I have been singing for a long time, and I think that [SNL creator] Lorne Michaels knows that ... it's not a fluke decision."[57]
